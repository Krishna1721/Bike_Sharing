# Bike_Sharing
#Data Loading: Start by loading the provided dataset into your Jupyter notebook. You can use libraries like Pandas to read the data from a CSV file.

#Data Preprocessing:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Handle missing values, if any, in the dataset.
Convert categorical variables with numeric labels (like 'weathersit' and 'season') into categorical strings.
Evaluate whether to keep the 'yr' column based on its importance.
Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.
Data Visualization and Exploration:

Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore relationships between variables.
Plot graphs and charts to understand the distribution of bike demand, seasonal trends, and any other insights that may be relevant.
Model Building:

Choose an appropriate machine learning model for the regression task. Linear regression is a good starting point for predicting bike demand.
Split the data into features (independent variables) and the target variable ('cnt').
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Evaluation:

Calculate the R-squared score on the test set to evaluate the model's performance.
Use the r2_score function from Scikit-Learn to calculate the R-squared score.
Model Interpretation:

Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of different features on bike demand.
Discuss the significance of variables and how well they explain the bike demand.
